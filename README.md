# SQLAlchemy-Easy-Connection
Simple way to connect Database using SQLAlchemy.
## Project motivations
This repository makes use of trivial options in the creation of the database engine.
My intention is to facilitate the connection to the database using SQLAlchemy, distributing this package that I created and use many years ago, I intend over time to add standard options for each type of database, making only you worry about connecting to the database.


Suggestions, improvements and contact, I am available at email: 'marcus.paiva.ti@gmail.com'.
